# Number Guessing Game
 
This Python program is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

How to Play:
1. Enter a Number: When prompted, enter a positive number. This number will determine the range in which the random number will be generated.

2. Make a Guess: After entering the number, the program will generate a random number within the specified range. You'll then be prompted to guess this number.

3. Receive Feedback: After each guess, the program will provide feedback, letting you know if your guess is too high or too low.

4. Keep Guessing: Continue guessing until you correctly guess the random number.

5. Congratulations: Once you guess the number correctly, the program will congratulate you and display the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
